# WatchMeCode

A collection of simple scripts for making timelapse videos set to music

## Usage

Make sure you have avconv and mp3info installed (`apt-get install avconv mp3info`)

`./make-av-video.sh /path/to/video/file.mpg /path/to/audio/file.mp3`

This will make a video called `done.mp4` in the current directory.

This has not been thoroughly tested at all, only on Ubuntu
